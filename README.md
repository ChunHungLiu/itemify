# Itemify
A repository for Alvin Lin's and Justin He's web application for the
Riot Games API Challenge 2.0 of 2015.
This web app analyzes tens of thousands of high ranking games to determine
the best build for a champion. It constructs an item build JSON from that
build which you can download and load into League of Legends. You can also
download builds for all champions and load them into your game so that you
can be prepared no matter what champion you are playing.

# Overview
All data analysis is done on the backend with Python even though the server
is NodeJS. Scripts of interest are all located in ```/dataset/scripts```.
These scripts help us fetch all necessary data as well as parse it. Each
script is documented and contains detailed descriptions about its function.
```/dataset/builds``` contains all the JSON files generated by the scripts.
If League of Legends releases a new patch, all we have to do is run:
```
/dataset/scripts/get_stats_from_seed.py
/dataset/scripts/get_stats.py
/dataset/scripts/generate_champion_builds.py
```
to update the data. Due to rate limiting on Riot's API key, get_stats.py will
usually take about 18~ hours since we aggregate data on 150k games.

# Data Aggregation
Our algorithm to aggregate game data starts with a few summoners known as
"seed" summoners. We query their past games and the past games of the teammates
they have had in the past games. Then we recursively query those teammate's
teammates until we have enough data. We use Bjergsen and WildTurtle as the
"seed" summoners but we should probably use the top ranking players in NA.
JK Bjergsen is life ```<3```.

# Data Analysis
When analyzing games, wins as well as KDA factor into the effectiveness of the
build. For every champion, each item that is built on that champion by any
player receives an effectiveness score that is based on whether or not the
player won as well as that player's KDA. The items are then sorted by type
and effectiveness. The builds are all constructed from these top items.
